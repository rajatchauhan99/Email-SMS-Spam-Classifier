# Email-SMS-Spam-Classifier
- I created an Email/SMS Spam Classifier using NLP and machine learning. This project involved comprehensive text preprocessing, feature extraction, and predictive modeling to classify emails and text messages as spam or not spam.

- During the project, I compared various vectorization techniques, including TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Bag of Words, to transform and prepare the text data effectively.

- I also experimented with advanced techniques like ensemble methods, stacking and voting classifiers to enhance the model's performance. Exploring a wide range of machine learning models, I aimed to find the most effective solution for the problem by using Multinomial NB.

- Leveraging the power of Python and libraries like NLTK, I built an interactive web app using Streamlit for easy testing.
